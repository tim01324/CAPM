# Controlling quality themes

conduct statistical QC, such as sampling and probability
inspect the product(escape defects)

attribiute sampling: defect or not
variavle sampling: how defet is it
special cause: unusual cause
random cause: common cause
check the tolerance range
control limits

# data gathering and analysis

check lists
check sheets

# cause and effect chart

Quality Control Overview and Statistical Sampling
Quality control is inspection-driven vs quality assurance which is prevention-driven
Cannot inspect quality into a project - must build it in from the start
Cost of poor quality becomes evident through quality control
If issues reach scope validation and customer sees them, can be embarrassing and expensive
Can cause customer to lose confidence in organization
Statistical sampling reduces quality control costs
Example: 20% of all units randomly selected for testing
Must be completed consistently throughout project
Can use regular schedule vs random testing for better reliability
Control charts are important exam topic - need to understand different portions and recognize patterns
Risk Fundamentals and Classification
Risk is uncertain event with potential positive or negative effects
Risk exists everywhere - stock market, driving, electricity, project investment itself
Two types of risk:
Pure risk: only negative effects (e.g., safety incidents)
Business risk: can have positive or negative effects (e.g., new equipment investment)
Risk processes occur throughout project lifecycle, not one-time activities
Risk Analysis Methods
Qualitative Risk Analysis:
High-level, subjective, quick overview
Uses ordinal scales (high/medium/low, red/amber/green, 1-10 ratings)
Probability impact matrix approach
Goal: identify high priority risks (high probability + high impact)
Qualifies risks for further quantitative study
Quantitative Risk Analysis:
Detailed analysis to quantify probability and impact
Typically quantifies impact in dollar amounts
Formula: Probability × Impact = Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
Sum of all EMVs = Contingency Reserve needed
Example: 80% probability × $100,000 impact = $80,000 risk exposure
Negative Risk Response Strategies
Escalate: Risk outside project manager's control, needs management decision
Avoid: Work around risk, sometimes by trimming scope
Transfer: Hire third party to own risk (e.g., electrician for electrical work)
Mitigate: Reduce probability and/or impact through additional actions
Example: Spending $30,000 to reduce 80% probability to 20%
Must justify cost vs benefit of mitigation
Accept: Low probability/impact risks or unavoidable risks
Low priority risks go on watch list for periodic monitoring
Positive Risk Response Strategies
Escalate: Good opportunity outside project manager's authority
Exploit: High confidence positive risk will happen, take advantage
Example: New equipment to finish early and earn bonus
Share: Partner with another organization to realize positive risk
Example: Partnering with competitor to handle large training contract
Enhance: Try to make positive risk event happen
Example: Add resources to finish early and earn $1,000/day incentive
Accept: Low probability/impact positive risks
Risk Documentation and Monitoring
Risk register can be simple Excel spreadsheet containing:
Response strategies and specific actions
Triggers (warning signs that activate responses)
Budget and schedule impacts
Risk owners and their responsibilities
Contingency and fallback plans
Residual Risk: Smaller risks created by risk responses
Secondary Risk: New risks created by risk responses (not necessarily smaller)
Risk monitoring produces work performance information and may require change requests
Decision Analysis Tools
Decision trees examine cost/benefit of each decision outcome
Weighs probability of success for different decisions
Helps calculate value of decisions to determine best option
Can be done with software or hand-drawn
Cost-Benefit Analysis of Risk Responses
Must consider cost of prevention vs cost of occurrence
Risk tolerance affects willingness to spend on mitigation
Can wait until "last responsible moment" to implement response
Example: 80% risk of $100,000 impact - spend $30,000 now to mitigate or gamble on 20% chance it won't happen
Time sensitivity important - delays create ripple effects beyond immediate costs

Project Management Plan Overview
Comprehensive document describing project intentions and execution approach
Communicates how to initiate, plan, execute, monitor/control, and close project phases
Serves as guide for project manager and team regarding execution, quality, risk, communication expectations
Provides structure defining path from current state to desired future state
Documents baselines: scope, schedule, cost (performance measurement baseline)
Enables forecasting of timeline, costs, deliverables through S-curve projections
Living document updated throughout project lifecycle, not static museum piece
Can leverage organizational process assets (OPA) templates from similar projects
Manufacturer example: standardized template adapted per project size/complexity
Triple Constraints Framework
Predictive Projects: Iron triangle with scope, time, cost as variables
Scope increase requires more money and time
Scope decrease allows time/cost reduction
Equilateral triangle relationship
Adaptive Projects: Inverted iron triangle with fixed time and cost
Limited budget and timeline constraints
Work prioritized by importance/value
Incomplete items are lower value than completed work
Balance requirement: scope must align with available time and budget
Planning Participants and Roles
Project Manager/Scrum Master: Lead facilitation, organization, direction, expert judgment
Team Members: Closest to work, greatest project success influence
Provide work knowledge and task duration estimates
Help develop schedules and identify risks
Contribute expert judgment
Customers/Product Owner/Business Analyst: Define objectives, quality requirements
Influence budget and schedule decisions
Management/Project Sponsor: Approval authority for budget, resources, methodology
Approve overall project management plan
Predictive Environment Components
Management Plans: Scope, configuration, cost, schedule, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholder engagement
Baselines: Scope, cost, schedule, performance measurement baseline (PMB)
Project Documents: Activity attributes/list/resource requirements, agreements/contracts, estimation basis
Change log, forecasting, procurement documents (SOW, RFPs, RFQs, ITBs)
Issue log, milestone list, funding requirements, project schedule/calendars
Quality checklists, network diagrams, critical path analysis
Staff assignments, requirements documentation/traceability matrix
Risk register, resource breakdown structure, stakeholder register
Work breakdown structure, performance reports/data
Adaptive Environment Components
Project Vision: Overall goals and objectives
Product Roadmap: Path from current state to completion with intermediate deliverables
User Stories: Requirements written from end-user perspective
Format: "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [value]"
Example: "As a salesperson, I want to enter orders on my phone so I can start fulfillment process sooner"
Release Plans: Features/functionalities for each release iteration
Iteration Plans: Specific work for each development cycle
Project vs Product Management Plans
Project Management Plan: Focus on HOW to get from here to there
What project will create/deliver and how
Execution, monitoring, controlling framework
Predictive: comprehensive planning vs Adaptive: minimal planning welcoming change
Product Management Plan: Focus on the THING being created
Product lifecycle management and maintenance
Timeline of product versions and features
Roadmap for product team aligned with organizational values
Components: vision, target market, positioning, roadmap, marketing/sales, development, launch, budget, KPIs, risk management
Scope Distinctions
Product Scope: Features and functions of the deliverable
Project Scope: All required work to satisfy product scope objectives
Includes training, equipment rental, temporary resources
Example: Building house requires equipment rental, but customer doesn't receive equipment
Duration Differences: Projects are temporary, products have extended lifecycle with maintenance
Team Differences: Project teams assemble temporarily, product teams provide ongoing support

Project Management Fundamentals Training Overview
Educational lecture covering core project management concepts
Focus on milestones, project phases, work breakdown structure, and resource planning
Instructor using personal anecdotes and construction analogies to explain concepts
Targeted at exam preparation for project management certification
Milestones and Progress Tracking
Milestones show progress toward project completion, not time-based markers
Historical origin: Roman mile markers (stones) showing distance traveled
Construction example: foundation completion, framing done, plumbing/electrical installed
Predictive environments typically have milestone at end of each phase
Quality control and scope validation often tied to milestones
City inspectors analogy for milestone reviews and approvals
Actual vs planned milestone dates reveal tracking accuracy against estimates
Project Phases and Phase Gates
Project lifecycle example: planning → requirements approval → design → coding → testing → deployment → maintenance
Each phase has associated milestone marking completion
Phase gates serve as go/no-go decision points between phases
Kill points allow project termination based on performance review
Time, cost, KPI performance evaluation
Market window considerations
Profitability assessments
Quality control and scope validation required before advancing phases
Corrective action may be required to pass phase gates
Work Breakdown Structure and Task Management
WBS is deliverable-oriented decomposition of project scope
Simple approach: organize WBS by project phases
House construction example: foundation → interior/exterior → floors → rooms
Work packages are smallest WBS items
Activity list derived from WBS work packages
8/80 rule: activities should be 8-80 hours duration
Task list separate document from WBS
Activities feed into schedule network diagrams
Resource Planning and Management
Two main categories: human resources (labor/effort) and physical resources
Human resources include physical labor and knowledge work
Physical resources: equipment, materials, facilities, software
Project scope complexity determines resource requirements
Larger, complex projects require more resources than smaller ones
Resource-Related Risks and Constraints
Physical resource risks:
Transportation from supplier to job site
Security and theft prevention
Weather damage protection
Safety hazards and training requirements
Human resource risks:
Competency and training needs
Key personnel departure (single points of failure)
Availability across multiple projects
Operational duties competing with project time
Resource availability creates project constraints
Budget constraints limit vendor/resource selection options
Schedule Impact and Resource Allocation
Schedule duration affects resource needs
Tight deadlines may require crashing (adding more labor)
Effort-driven vs fixed-duration activities
Effort-driven: can add labor to accelerate
Fixed-duration: cannot accelerate regardless of resources
Resource leveling when team members split time between projects/operations
Internal billing systems for cross-departmental resource usage
Role-based hourly rates (e.g., instructional designer $80/hour, trainer $150/hour)
Service level agreements between departments
Blue dollars for internal cost accounting
