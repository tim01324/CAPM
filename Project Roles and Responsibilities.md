Summary
Overview: CAPM Exam Project Manager Role Training

Educational content covering project manager responsibilities for CAPM certification
Instructor explaining both predictive and agile methodologies
Focus on role recognition requirements for exam success
Emphasis on increasing agile content in PMI examinations

Project Manager Core Responsibilities

Oversight and responsibility for all project facets
Planner coordinating team activities and resources
Resource manager handling physical materials and human resources
Construction example: coordinating material delivery timing
Balance between early delivery (space constraints) and delays


Progress monitor tracking activity completion toward milestones
Communicator spending 90% of time in communication activities
Scope controller maintaining approved project boundaries
Predictive: very averse to scope changes after approval
Quality issues = scope changes requiring corrective action


Project closer handling phase transitions and final closure
Financial accounting and quality reviews
Scope validation and stakeholder sign-offs
Resource transitions between phases



Project Planning Development

Begin with end result definition: what do we want to achieve?
Projects create MACD: Moving, Adding, Changing, or Deleting
Define project scope first before estimating time/cost
Set goals and objectives with potential business analyst collaboration
Determine tasks and milestones
Milestones: timeless activities showing progress
House building example: blueprints → permits → foundation → framing


Create budget based on estimates including timing of expenditures

Team Leadership Approach

Get people to want to do work vs. commanding compliance
Help team inherit vision and see project impact
Communicate excitement about organizational/community benefits
Assign tasks through agreement rather than authority
Provide support and guidance with emotional intelligence

Resource Management Strategies

Labor typically biggest project expense
Two models: overhead vs. direct project cost
Generic role pricing ($75/hour examples)
Inter-department service level agreements
Step funding tied to milestone achievements
Equipment rental/lease timing coordination
Contractor accountability and ethical billing practices
Story: 4-5 months of unproductive contractor billing
Importance of actual work vs. billable hours



Progress Monitoring Techniques

Predictive: status reports and work performance information
Agile: iteration reviews and demos
Evidence required for downstream activity authorization
Predecessor-successor relationship tracking
Stakeholder communication through reports and information radiators
Issue vs. risk distinction
Risk: uncertain future event (positive/negative)
Issue: negative risk that has definitely occurred


Roadblock identification: impediments preventing team progress
Examples: manager approvals, inspector delays, permit processing



Stakeholder Communication Management

Continuous communication of progress, changes, and issues
Meeting efficiency focus
Meetings need clear objectives and agendas
30-minute meeting with 8 people = 4 hours labor cost
Avoid WOT (Waste of Time) meetings
Time-boxed meetings with specific purposes



Scope Control and Change Management

Scope creep definition: unauthorized small additions
Customer direct requests to team members
Team member "good idea" additions
Predictive: strict change control process required
Agile: welcome change but through product owner and backlog
Changes must follow appropriate approval channels

Project Closure Activities

Data collection and performance analysis
Baseline vs. actual comparisons (cost, schedule, scope)
Re-baselining only with proper approvals
Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) combining time/cost/scope
Final project reports and customer reviews
Scope validation and acceptance
Certificate of completion for large projects

Action Items

 Study PMI's increasing focus on agile methodologies for CAPM exam
 Practice recognizing different project roles in both predictive and agile environments
 Review scope creep scenarios and change control processes
 Understand milestone vs. activity distinctions for exam questions
 Memorize the MACD concept (Moving, Adding, Changing, Deleting)
 Study Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) calculations
 Review contractor management and ethical billing practices
 Practice distinguishing between risks and issues in scenarios
